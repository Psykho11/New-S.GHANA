              <div class="abacus-text">
                <h2>History of Abacus</h2>
                <p>Abacus, one of the significant calculation methods with a crucial contribution to the development of China, originated 2,600 years ago. Known as the Fifth Great Invention of China, abacus was named as the “101 inventions that changed the world” which have promoted the development of human society, within which the abacus ranks the first.</p>
                
                <div class="abacus-image">
                  <!-- Image in the middle of the text -->
                  <img src="images/history_banner.jpg" alt="Abacus" />
                </div>
                
                <p>While ancient Greek mathematics focused on theorem proving, ancient Chinese mathematics focused on algorithm development, particularly for solving equations; it intended to address practical issues and was characterised by algorithm and mechanisation, in other words, Mathematical Decomposition. From which, students who were taught abacus have an easier time grasping Mathematical topics and thrive in Science due to their innate problem-solving skills.</p>
                
                <p>Abacus and Mental Arithmetic has aided people in developing their mathematical skills and interests, and its educational implications in other subjects are highly significant.</p>
                
                <h3>Why Abacus?</h3>
                <p>Why do we still teach an ancient tool in a high-tech computing world?</p>
                
                <p>Some parents consider abacus training as a way to improve their children’s mathematical ability, only to find out later that they don't only excel mathematically but also exhibited some extraordinary skills and benefits that radiated onto all subjects in their education. These intangible skills progressed further into their adult life. Some of these intangible skills included: Focus, Memory, Observation, Perceptivity, Thinking, Imaginations, Strategic Thinking, Independence, Organizing, etc.</p>

                <p>In Ghana, where education is considered the gateway to success, the use of abacus can be a powerful tool to enhance the mathematical abilities of students. The traditional approach to learning math, while still effective, may not always be engaging or practical for young learners in the modern world. With the adoption of abacus training, students are introduced to a dynamic, hands-on approach that not only helps them master calculations but also sharpens their cognitive skills.</p>
                
                <p>Moreover, as Ghana continues to push for an increase in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education, the introduction of abacus training complements this initiative by developing problem-solving skills that students can carry into their later academic and professional lives. The benefits are clear: abacus students in Ghana tend to show improved concentration, faster mental math abilities, and stronger memory retention, making them more competitive in the classroom and beyond.</p>
          
                <p>The ability to perform quick mental arithmetic is crucial not only in mathematics but also in day-to-day life. Whether it’s calculating change at a market, budgeting household expenses, or even excelling in higher education, abacus-trained students are more prepared to take on these challenges confidently. Through the widespread implementation of abacus training, Shenmo Ghana aims to foster a generation of students with exceptional cognitive abilities who can contribute meaningfully to the nation's growth and development.</p>
